# ProjetoCM - RunRoute

RunRoute is a running companion app that tracks details of a running session. The app allows the user to create a session preset to be used multiple times. During a running session the app shows a map with the user's path drawn on it and details about the session (duration, distance, calories burned, etc...).
A session history is kept so the user can evaluate his progress.

In order to build the project you need to add a Google Maps API key to the local.properties file like this:
````
MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
````
